To do this, we will use TensorFlow Lite. TensorFlow Lite has limited features but is faster and lighter than TensorFlow. When you install TensorFlow on Raspberry Pi and laptop, TensorFlow Lite module is automatically installed. Because it supports Keras interface, TensorFlow Lite is able to load and run the CNN model developed in the prelab using TensorFlow and Keras.\n","\n","The best way to practice implementation of the trained model is to program yourself. Because of the limited time in the lab, however, the complete sample code ([lab10_sample2.py](https://github.com/purduelamm/purdue_me597_iiot_online/blob/main/lab/lab10/lab10_sample_code/lab10_sample2.py?raw=true)) is given. The simplified flowchart of the sample code is shown in Figure 5. Perform Task 2.1 to interpret the CNN model result (7th block - Algorithm to interpret CNN model result in Figure 5) as the appropriate label. Note that the CNN model (h5 format) must be in the same directory in which the sample code is.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/purduelamm/purdue_me597_iiot_online/blob/main/lab/img/lab10_fig5.png?raw=true\" width=\"50%\">\n","\n","*Figure 5 Flowchart of lab10_sample2.py*"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EBM_C9jijQKA"},"source":["### Task 2.1\n","\n","Run [lab10_sample2.py](https://github.com/purduelamm/purdue_me597_iiot_online/blob/main/lab/lab10/lab10_sample_code/lab10_sample2.py?raw=true) on your Raspberry Pi or laptop see if the CNN model works well.

Complete the algorithm so that appropriate label is printed out at the end.
